# E-commerce Big Data Analysis with PySpark

- This repository contains a practice project for large-scale e-commerce data analysis with PySpark.
- It is intended as a portfolio/CV project to demonstrate skills in data engineering, data analysis, and reporting.

The workflow is:

1. Generate a large synthetic e-commerce dataset with `./data/generate_bigdata.py`.
2. Analyze and explore the data in the notebook `./scripts/E-commerce_business_report.ipynb` using PySpark, pandas, and related tools.
3. Render a polished HTML business report with **Quarto**, using a custom theme based on the *Arrakis Night* theme from PyCharm.

The final report is available as a rendered HTML file in `./docs/E-commerce_business_report.html` and is also published via GitHub Pages at:

## Data Generation

- The dataset used in this project is **synthetic** and generated locally. The raw CSV (~345 MB) is **not committed to the repository** to keep the repo size reasonable.
- Instead, you should generate your own dataset before running the analysis.

To generate (or regenerate) the data:

1. Make sure your Python environment is activated.
2. Run the generator script:

```bash
python .\data\generate_bigdata.py
```

- This will create (or overwrite) `data/ecommerce_5m.csv` with a large number of simulated e-commerce transactions (~345 MB by default).

## Environment & Dependencies

Python dependencies for the analysis are listed in `requirements.txt`:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- duckdb
- pyspark
- python-dateutil

Install them into your environment, for example with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: This project assumes you have a working local PySpark setup. Depending on your platform, you may need to install Java and/or configure Spark separately.

## Quarto Report Generation

The final HTML report is rendered with **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)** from the notebook `scripts/E-commerce_business_report.ipynb`.

### 1. Install Quarto

Quarto is not installed via `requirements.txt`; you need to install it separately.

On Windows, download the installer from the official website or use `winget`:

```bash
winget install quarto.quarto
```

(Alternatively, see https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ for OS-specific instructions.)

### 2. Render the Report

Once Quarto is installed and your Python environment is set up **and the data has been generated**:

```bash
quarto render .\scripts\E-commerce_business_report.ipynb --to html --output-dir docs
```

This will:

- Execute the notebook
- Apply the custom `quarto_arrakis-night.scss` theme
- Write/update `docs/E-commerce_business_report.html` (used by GitHub Pages)
- Store supporting assets in `scripts/E-commerce_business_report_files/`

---

## Custom Theme (Arrakis Night)

The visual style of the report is based on the **Arrakis Night** theme from PyCharm, adapted for Quarto:

- `themes/quarto_arrakis-night.scss` defines the Quarto page theme (colors, typography, code blocks, etc.).
- `themes/plot_arrakis_night_style.py` provides a Python helper to align Matplotlib plots with the same visual style.

This demonstrates how to:

- Bring an IDE theme into a data report
- Keep notebook visualizations stylistically consistent with the HTML output

## How to Use This Project

If you want to reproduce or modify the analysis:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Generate the dataset: `python .\data\generate_bigdata.py` (CSV is ~345 MB and is not version-controlled).
5. Install Quarto and render the report: `quarto render .\scripts\E-commerce_business_report.ipynb --to html --output-dir docs`.

Feel free to adapt the data generation, analysis logic, or theming for your own experiments or reports.
